This repository uses a Rust codebase.

* Always run `cargo fmt --all` on the repository before creating a pull request. If `cargo fmt` fails due to missing dependencies, install them if possible.
* Make a best effort to check for typos, remove copy-paste and perform minor refactoring during any task.
* After code changes, run `cargo check` to verify the code compiles.
